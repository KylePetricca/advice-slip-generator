## My process

I had a great time creating the advice slip generator and was able to create a polished and responsive user interface. My first focus was on implementing essential CSS and HTML styling. Since the design looked the same on both mobile and desktop views, I only made small changes to the divider image using media queries to make sure it looked good on different screen sizes. This made for a seamless and visually pleasing experience for users no matter what device they were using.

 I then integrated the advice slip API using JavaScript and made sure to use async/await to fetch advice data from the API endpoint from the [advice slip api website](https://api.adviceslip.com/advice). On the webpage, I displayed both the unique ID and advice. I also added error handling to ensure a smooth experience for users in case of any problems. The final product is a reliable advice slip generator that provides valuable insights with just one click.


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Advice Slip API


### What I learned

As I worked on this project, I became more comfortable and confident in using APIs. Integrating the advice slip generator API gave me a good experience and improved my understanding of API usage.


### Continued development

Integrating the advice slip generator API into this project was a valuable learning experience; I have worked with API once before but moving forward, I am enthusiastic about expanding my expertise in working with APIs and undertaking more sophisticated projects that leverage their capabilities. 

APIs are powerful tools that give access to a wide range of functionalities, and I am keen to explore new challenges and create increasingly sophisticated applications with their integration.


### Useful resources

- [ByteGrad Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@ByteGrad) - This YouTube channel has been amazing for developing my knowldege on intergrating API's into my programs. He explains the syntax and the reasoning behind it very clearly and makes concepts I had previous difficulties understanding, much easier to grasp.
